My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine, you make me smile with my heart. Your looks are laughable, unphotographable, yet you're my favorite work of art. Is your figure less than Greek? Is your mouth a little weak when you open it to speak? Are you small? Don't change a hair for me, not if you care for me. Stay, little Valentine, stay. Each day, Valentines, days. You're my favorite work of art, but don't change a hair for me.Not if you care for me. Stay, little Valentine. Won't you stay? Each day is Valentine's Day.
