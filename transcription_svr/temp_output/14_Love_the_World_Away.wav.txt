Every now and then,
when the world
steps in,
stealing all
our
time
away,
it
soon takes all my.
We forget to touch.
That's when I know it's time for me to say.
Take my
hand.
Let's
walk
through
love's door and be free from the world once more.
Use my heart.
We can hide today and love the world away.
Once again,
we'll be where our hearts are free,
and the time is ours to share.
Love will always stay,
just let's
find a way.
Come with me.
All the magic's waiting there.
Take my hand.
Let's walk through love's door and be free from the world once more.
Use my heart.
We can hide today and love the world away.
We can love the world again.
