Just look at you sitting there.
You
never looked better than tonight,
and it'd be so easy to tell you I'd stay,
like I've done so many times.
I was sure
this would be the night.
You close the door and want to stay with me,
and it'd be so easy to tell you I'd stay,
like I've done so many times.
Don't fall in love with a dreamer,
'cause he'll
always take you in.
Just when you think you've really changed him,
he'll leave you again.
Don't fall in love with a dreamer,
'cause you break you every time.
Oh,
just hold on before we
say
goodbye.
Now
it's morning and the phone rings and you say you've got to get your things together.
You just gotta leave before you change your mind.
And if you knew what I was thinking,
girl,
I'd turn around.
If you would just ask me one more time.
Don't fall in love
with a dreamer,
'cause he'll always take you in.
Just when you think you've really changed him,
he'll leave you again.
Don't fall in love with a dreamer,
'cause you break you every time.
Oh.
Put out the light and just hold on
before
we say
goodbye.
Before
we
say goodbye.
Goodbye.
