On a warm summer's eve,
on a train bound for nowhere,
I met up with a gambler.
We were both too tired to sleep,
so we took turns of staring out the window at the
darkness to boredom or to curses.
And he began to speak.
He said,
Son,
I need a light out of reading people's faces and knowing what the cards were by the way they held their eyes.
So if you don't mind me saying,
I can see right out of eyes for a taste of your whiskey.
I'll give you some advice.
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
And
the night got deathly quiet and
his face lost all expression.
Said,
If you're gonna play the game boy,
you gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hold,
know when to fold up,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sitting at the
table.
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing's done.
Every gambler knows that the secret to surviving is knowing what to throw away,
knowing what to keep.
'Cause every hand's a winner and every
hand's a loser and the
best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.
And when he finished speaking,
he turned back toward the window,
crushed out his cigarette,
faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness,
the gambler he broke even.
But in his final words,
I found an ace that I could keep.
You got to know when to hold,
know when to fold up,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sitting at the table.
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing's
done.
You got to know when to hold,
know when to fold up,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your
money when you're sitting at the table.
There'll be time enough for counting.
When the dealing's done,
you got to know when to hold 'em,
know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away,
and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sitting at the table.
There'll be time enough for counting
when the deal is done.
