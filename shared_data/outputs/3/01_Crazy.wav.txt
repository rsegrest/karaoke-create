Crazy,
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely.
I'm crazy,
crazy for feeling so blue.
I knew you'd love
me
as long as you wanted,
and then someday you'd leave me for somebody new.
Oh,
worry,
why do I let myself worry?
Wondering what in the world did I do?
Oh,
crazy for thinking that my love could hold you.
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying,
and I'm crazy for loving you.
Oh,
worry,
why do I let myself worry?
Wondering what in the world did I do?
Oh,
crazy for thinking
that
my love could hold you.
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying,
and I'm crazy
for loving.
You.
